        <lb/>Dim vales—and shadowy floods—
        <lb/>And cloudy-looking woods,
        <lb/>Whose forms we can't discover
        <lb/>For the tears that drip all over
        <lb/>Huge moons there <verb value="open">wax</verb> and <verb value="closed">wane</verb>—
        <lb/>Again—again—again—
        <lb/>Every moment of the night—
        <lb/>Forever changing places—
        <lb/>And they put <adv value="open">out</adv> the star-light
        <lb/>With the breath from their pale faces.
        <lb/>About twelve by the moon-dial
        <lb/>One more filmy than the rest
        <lb/>(A kind which, upon trial,
        <lb/>They have found to be the best)
        <lb/>Comes <adv value="closed">down</adv>—still <prep value="closed">down</prep>—and <verb value="closed">down</verb>
        <lb/>With its centre on the crown
        <lb/>Of a mountain's eminence,
        <lb/>While its wide <noun value="closed">circumference</noun>
        <lb/>In easy drapery <verb value="closed">falls</verb>
        <lb/>Over <foreign lang="fr">hamlets</foreign>, over halls,
        <lb/>Wherever they may be—
        <lb/>O'er the strange woods—o'er the sea—
        <lb/>Over spirits on the wing—
        <lb/>Over every drowsy thing—
        <lb/>And <verb value="closed">buries</verb> them up quite
        <lb/>In a <noun value="closed">labyrinth</noun> of light—
        <lb/>And then, how <adj value="closed">deep</adj>!—O, <adj value="closed">deep</adj>!
        <lb/>Is the passion of their sleep.
        <lb/>In the morning they <verb value="open">arise</verb>,
        <lb/>And their moony <noun value="closed">covering</noun>
        <lb/>Is <verb value="open">soaring</verb> in the <noun value="open">skies</noun>,
        <lb/>With the tempests as they toss,
        <lb/>Like—almost any thing—
        <lb/>Or a yellow Albatross.
        <lb/>They use that moon no more
        <lb/>For the same end as before—
        <lb/><foreign lang="latin">Videlicet</foreign> a tent—
        <lb/>Which I think extravagant:
        <lb/>Its atomies, however,
        <lb/><prep value="closed">Into</prep> a shower <foreign lang="latin">dissever</foreign>,
        <lb/>Of which those butterflies,
        <lb/>Of Earth, who seek the <noun value="open">skies</noun>,
        <lb/>And so come <adv value="closed">down</adv> again
        <lb/>(Never-contented thing!)
        <lb/>Have brought a specimen
        <lb/>Upon their quivering wings.
