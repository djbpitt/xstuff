        <title>ANNABEL LEE</title>
    </meta>

    
        <stanza>
            <lb/>It was many and many a year ago,
            <lb/><prep value="open">In</prep> a kingdom by the sea,
            <lb/>That a maiden there lived whom you may know
            <lb/>By the name of ANNABEL LEE;
            <lb/>And this maiden she lived with no other thought
            <lb/>Than to love and be loved by me.
        </stanza>

        <stanza>
            <lb/>I was a child and she was a child,
            <lb/><prep value="open">In</prep> this kingdom by the sea:
            <lb/>But we loved with a love that was more than love--
            <lb/>I and my ANNABEL LEE;
            <lb/>With a love that the <adj value="closed">winged</adj> <noun value="closed">seraphs</noun> of <noun value="closed">heaven</noun>
            <lb/><verb value="open">Coveted</verb> her and me.
        </stanza>

        <stanza>
            <lb/>And this was the reason that, long ago,
            <lb/><prep value="open">In</prep> this kingdom by the sea,
            <lb/>A wind <verb value="closed">blew</verb> <prep value="closed">out</prep> of a cloud, chilling
            <lb/>My beautiful ANNABEL LEE;
            <lb/>So that her highborn kinsmen <verb value="open">came</verb>
            <lb/>And <verb value="open">bore</verb> her <prep value="closed">away</prep> <prep value="closed">from</prep> me,
            <lb/>To <verb value="open">shut</verb> her <prep value="closed">up</prep> <prep value="open">in</prep> a <noun value="open">sepulchre</noun>
            <lb/><prep value="open">In</prep> this kingdom by the sea.
        </stanza>

        <stanza>
            <lb/>The <noun value="closed">angels</noun>, not half so happy <prep value="open">in</prep> <noun value="closed">heaven</noun>,
            <lb/><verb value="closed">Went</verb> envying her and me--
            <lb/>Yes!--that was the reason (as all men know,
            <lb/><prep value="open">In</prep> this kingdom by the sea)
            <lb/>That the wind <verb value="open">came</verb> <prep value="closed">out</prep> of the cloud by night,
            <lb/>Chilling and <verb value="open">killing</verb> my ANNABEL LEE.
        </stanza>

        <stanza>
            <lb/>But our love it was stronger by far than the love
            <lb/>Of those who were older than we--
            <lb/>Of many far wiser than we--
            <lb/>And neither the <noun value="closed">angels</noun> <prep value="open">in</prep> <noun value="closed">heaven</noun> <prep value="closed">above</prep>,
            <lb/>Nor the <noun value="open">demons</noun> <prep value="open">down</prep> <prep value="open">under</prep> the sea,
            <lb/>Can ever <verb value="closed">dissever</verb> my <noun value="closed">soul</noun> from the <noun value="closed">soul</noun>
            <lb/>Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE.
        </stanza>

        <stanza>
            <lb/>For the <noun value="closed">moon</noun> never <verb value="closed">beams</verb> <prep value="closed">without</prep> <verb value="open">bringing</verb> me dreams
            <lb/>Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE;
            <lb/>And the <noun value="closed">stars</noun> never <verb value="closed">rise</verb> but I see the bright eyes
            <lb/>Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE;
            <lb/>And so, all the night-tide, I <verb value="open">lie</verb> <prep value="open">down</prep> by the side
            <lb/>Of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride,
            <lb/><prep value="open">In</prep> her <noun value="open">sepulchre</noun> there by the sea--
            <lb/><prep value="open">In</prep> her <noun value="open">tomb</noun> by the side of the sea.
