        <lb/>There are some qualities—some incorporate things,
        <lb/>That have a double life, which thus is made
        <lb/>A type of that twin entity which springs
        <lb/><prep value="open">From</prep> matter and <noun value="open">light</noun>, <verb value="open">evinced</verb> in <noun value="closed">solid</noun> and <noun value="closed">shade</noun>.
        <lb/>There is a twofold <noun value="closed">Silence</noun>—<noun value="open">sea</noun> and <noun value="open">shore</noun>—
        <lb/>Body and soul. One dwells in <adj value="closed">lonely</adj> places,
        <lb/>Newly with grass <adj value="closed">o'ergrown</adj>; some solemn graces,
        <lb/>Some human memories and tearful lore,
        <lb/>Render him terrorless: his name's "No More."
        <lb/>He is the corporate <noun value="closed">Silence</noun>: dread him not!
        <lb/>No power hath he of evil <prep value="closed">in</prep> himself;
        <lb/>But should some urgent fate (untimely lot!)
        <lb/>Bring thee to meet his shadow (nameless elf,
        <lb/>That haunteth the lone regions where hath trod
        <lb/>No foot of man), commend thyself to God!
