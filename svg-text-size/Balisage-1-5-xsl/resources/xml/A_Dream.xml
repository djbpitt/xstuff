        <stanza>
            <lb/><prep value="closed">In</prep> visions of the dark night
            <lb/>I have dreamed of joy <verb value="open">departed</verb>--
            <lb/>But a waking dream of life and light
            <lb/>Hath <verb value="open">left</verb> me <adj value="open">broken</adj>-hearted.
        </stanza>

        <stanza>
            <lb/>Ah! what is not a dream by day
            <lb/>To him whose eyes are cast
            <lb/>On things around him with a ray
            <lb/>Turned back <prep value="open">upon</prep> the past?
        </stanza>

        <stanza>
            <lb/>That holy dream--that holy dream,
            <lb/>While all the world were chiding,
            <lb/>Hath cheered me as a lovely beam,
            <lb/>A <adj value="closed">lonely</adj> spirit guiding.
        </stanza>

        <stanza>
            <lb/>What though that light, thro' storm and night,
            <lb/>So trembled from afar--
            <lb/>What could there be more purely bright
            <lb/>In Truth's day <noun value="open">star</noun>?
        </stanza>
