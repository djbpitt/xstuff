<poem><meta><title>The Coliseum</title></meta>

<stanza><lb/>Type of the antique Rome! Rich reliquary
<lb/>Of <adj value="open">lofty</adj> contemplation left to Time
<lb/>By <adj value="closed">buried</adj> centuries of pomp and power!
<lb/>At length—at length—after so many days
<lb/>Of weary pilgrimage and burning thirst,
<lb/>(Thirst for the springs of lore that in thee <verb value="closed">lie</verb>,)
<lb/>I kneel, an altered and an humble man,
<lb/><prep value="closed">Amid</prep> thy shadows, and so drink within
<lb/>My very soul thy <noun value="open">grandeur</noun>, <noun value="closed">gloom</noun>, and glory!</stanza>

<stanza><lb/><noun value="open">Vastness</noun>! and Age! and Memories of Eld!
<lb/><noun value="closed">Silence</noun>! and <noun value="closed">Desolation</noun>! and <adj value="closed">dim</adj> <noun value="closed">Night</noun>!
<lb/>I feel ye now—I feel ye in your strength—
<lb/>O spells more sure than e'er <ref value="religious">Judæan king</ref>
<lb/>Taught in the <ref value="place">gardens of Gethsemane</ref>!
<lb/>O charms more potent than the rapt <ref value="nation">Chaldee</ref>
<lb/>Ever drew <adv value="closed">down</adv> <prep value="open">from</prep> <adv value="open">out</adv> the quiet <noun value="open">stars</noun>!</stanza>

<stanza><lb/>Here, where a hero <verb value="closed">fell</verb>, a column <verb value="closed">falls</verb>!
<lb/>Here, where the mimic eagle glared in gold,
<lb/>A <noun value="closed">midnight</noun> vigil holds the swarthy bat!
<lb/>Here, where the dames of Rome their gilded hair
<lb/>Waved to the wind, now wave the reed and thistle!
<lb/>Here, where <prep value="closed">on</prep> golden throne the monarch lolled,
<lb/>Glides, spectre-like, unto his marble home,
<lb/>Lit by the wan light of the horned <noun value="open">moon</noun>,
<lb/>The swift and silent lizard of the stones!</stanza>

<stanza><lb/>But stay! these <noun value="closed">walls</noun>—these ivy-clad <noun value="closed">arcades</noun>—
<lb/>These mouldering plinths—these sad and blackened shafts—
<lb/>These vague entablatures—this crumbling frieze—
<lb/>These shattered cornices—this wreck—this ruin—
<lb/>These stones—alas! these gray stones—are they all—
<lb/>All of the famed, and the colossal left
<lb/>By the corrosive Hours to Fate and me?</stanza>

<stanza><lb/>"Not all"—the Echoes answer me—"not all!
<lb/>Prophetic sounds and loud, <verb value="open">arise</verb> forever
<lb/>From us, and from all Ruin, unto the wise,
<lb/>As melody from <ref value="myth">Memnon</ref> to the <noun value="open">Sun</noun>.
<lb/>We rule the hearts of mightiest men—we rule
<lb/>With a despotic sway all giant minds.
<lb/>We are not impotent—we pallid stones.
<lb/>Not all our power is gone—not all our fame—
<lb/>Not all the magic of our high renown—
<lb/>Not all the wonder that <verb value="closed">encircles</verb> us—
<lb/>Not all the mysteries that <prep value="closed">in</prep> us <verb value="closed">lie</verb>—
<lb/>Not all the memories that hang <prep value="closed">upon</prep>
<lb/>And cling around about us as a garment,
<lb/>Clothing us in a robe of more than glory."</stanza>
