    <stanza>
        <lb/>The <adj value="open">happiest</adj> day—the <adj value="open">happiest</adj> hour
        <lb/>My seared and <verb value="closed">blighted</verb> heart hath known,
        <lb/>The <adj value="open">highest</adj> hope of pride and power,
        <lb/>I feel hath <verb value="open">flown</verb>.
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
        <lb/>Of <noun value="open">power</noun>! said I? Yes! such I ween
        <lb/>But they have <verb value="closed">vanished</verb> long, alas!
        <lb/>The visions of my youth have been—
        <lb/>But let them pass.
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
        <lb/>And pride, what have I now with thee?
        <lb/>Another brow may ev'n inherit
        <lb/>The venom thou hast <verb value="closed">poured</verb> on me—
        <lb/>Be still my spirit!
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
        <lb/>The <adj value="open">happiest</adj> day—the <adj value="open">happiest</adj> hour
        <lb/>Mine eyes shall see—have ever seen
        <lb/>The brightest glance of pride and power
        <lb/>I feel have been:
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
        <lb/>But were that hope of pride and <noun value="closed">power</noun>
        <lb/>Now offered with the <noun value="closed">pain</noun>
        <lb/>Ev'n then I felt—that brightest hour
        <lb/>I would not live again:
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
        <lb/>For on its wing was dark alloy
        <lb/>And as it fluttered—<verb value="closed">fell</verb>
        <lb/>An essence—powerful to <verb value="closed">destroy</verb>
        <lb/>A soul that knew it well.
    </stanza>
