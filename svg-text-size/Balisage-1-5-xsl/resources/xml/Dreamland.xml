<stanza>
<lb/>By a route obscure and lonely,
<lb/>Haunted by ill <noun value="open">angels</noun> only,
<lb/>Where an Eidolon, named <noun value="closed">Night</noun>,
<lb/>On a black throne reigns upright,
<lb/>I have reached these lands but newly
<lb/>From an ultimate dim Thule—
<lb/>From a wild weird clime that <verb value="closed">lieth</verb>, sublime,
<lb/>Out of Space—out of Time.
</stanza> 

<stanza>
<lb/>Bottomless vales and boundless floods,
<lb/>And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods,
<lb/>With forms that no man can discover
<lb/>For the dews that drip all over;
<lb/>Mountains toppling evermore
<lb/>Into seas without a shore;
<lb/>Seas that restlessly aspire,
<lb/>Surging, unto skies of fire;
<lb/>Lakes that endlessly outspread
<lb/>Their lone waters—lone and dead,
<lb/>Their still waters—still and chilly
<lb/>With the snows of the lolling lily.
</stanza> 

<stanza>
<lb/>By the lakes that thus outspread
<lb/>Their lone waters, lone and dead,—
<lb/>Their sad waters, sad and chilly
<lb/>With the snows of the lolling lily,—
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>By the mountains—near the river
<lb/>Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever,—
<lb/>By the gray woods,—by the swamp
<lb/>Where the toad and the newt encamp,—
<lb/>By the dismal tarns and pools 
<lb/>Where dwell the Ghouls,—
<lb/>By each spot the most unholy—
<lb/>In each nook most melancholy,—
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>There the traveller meets aghast
<lb/>Sheeted Memories of the past—
<lb/>Shrouded forms that start and sigh
<lb/>As they pass the wanderer by—
<lb/>White-robed forms of friends long given,
<lb/>In agony, to the Earth—and Heaven.
</stanza> 

<stanza>
<lb/>For the heart whose woes are legion
<lb/>'Tis a peaceful, soothing region—
<lb/>For the spirit that walks in shadow
<lb/>'Tis—oh, 'tis an Eldorado!
<lb/>But the traveller, travelling through it,
<lb/>May not—dare not openly view it;
<lb/>Never its mysteries are exposed
<lb/>To the weak human eye unclosed;
<lb/>So wills its King, who hath forbid
<lb/>The uplifting of the fringed lid;
<lb/>And thus the sad Soul that here passes
<lb/>Beholds it but through darkened glasses.
</stanza> 

<stanza>
<lb/>By a route obscure and lonely,
<lb/>Haunted by ill angels only. 
<lb/>Where an Eidolon, named Night,
<lb/>On a black throne reigns upright,
<lb/>I have wandered home but newly
<lb/>From this ultimate dim Thule.
</stanza>
