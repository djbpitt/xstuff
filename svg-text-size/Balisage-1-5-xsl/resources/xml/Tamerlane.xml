            <lb/>Kind <noun value="open">solace</noun> <prep value="closed">in</prep> a <adj value="closed">dying</adj> hour!
            <lb/>Such, father, is not (now) my theme--
            <lb/>I will not madly deem that power
            <lb/>Of Earth may <verb value="closed">shrive</verb> me of the sin
            <lb/>Unearthly pride hath revelled <prep value="closed">in</prep>--
            <lb/>I have no time to dote or dream:
            <lb/>You call it hope--that fire of fire!
            <lb/>It is but <noun value="closed">agony</noun> of desire:
            <lb/>If I can hope--O <noun value="open">God</noun>! I can--
            <lb/>Its fount is holier--more divine--
            <lb/>I would not call thee fool, old man,
            <lb/>But such is not a gift of thine.
        </stanza>

        <stanza>
            <lb/>Know thou the <noun value="closed">secret</noun> of a spirit
            <lb/>Bowed from its wild pride <prep value="closed">into</prep> shame
            <lb/>O yearning heart! I did <verb value="open">inherit</verb>
            <lb/>Thy <adj value="closed">withering</adj> portion with the fame,
            <lb/>The searing glory which hath shone
            <lb/>Amid the Jewels of my throne,
            <lb/>Halo of <noun value="closed">Hell</noun>! and with a pain
            <lb/>Not <noun value="closed">Hell</noun> shall make me fear again--
            <lb/>O craving heart, for the <adj value="closed">lost</adj> flowers
            <lb/>And sunshine of my summer hours!
            <lb/>The <adj value="open">undying</adj> voice of that <adj value="closed">dead</adj> time,
            <lb/>With its interminable chime,
            <lb/>Rings, <prep value="closed">in</prep> the spirit of a spell,
            <lb/>Upon thy <noun value="closed">emptiness</noun>--a knell.

        <stanza>
            <lb/>I have not always been as now:

            <lb/><ref value="location">Rome</ref> to the <ref value="historical">CÃ¦sar</ref>--this to me?
            <lb/>The heritage of a kingly mind,

            <lb/>Triumphantly with human kind.
            <lb/>On mountain soil I first drew <noun value="open">life</noun>:

            <lb/>Nightly their dews <prep value="open">upon</prep> my head,
            <lb/>And, I believe, the winged strife
            <lb/>And tumult of the headlong air
            <lb/>Have nestled <prep value="closed">in</prep> my very hair.
        </stanza>

        <stanza>
            <lb/>So late from <noun value="open">Heaven</noun>--that dew--it <verb value="closed">fell</verb>

            <lb/>Appeared to my half-<adj value="closed">closing</adj> eye
            <lb/>The pageantry of monarchy;
            <lb/>And the <adj value="closed">deep</adj> trumpet-thunder's roar
            <lb/>Came hurriedly <prep value="open">upon</prep> me, telling
            <lb/>Of human battle, where my voice,
            <lb/>My own voice, silly child!--was <verb value="open">swelling</verb>
            <lb/>(O! how my spirit would rejoice,
            <lb/>And leap <prep value="closed">within</prep> me at the cry)
            <lb/>The battle-cry of Victory!
        </stanza>

        <stanza>
            <lb/>The rain came <prep value="closed">down</prep> <prep value="open">upon</prep> my head
            <lb/>Unsheltered--and the heavy wind
            <lb/>Rendered me mad and <adj value="closed">deaf</adj> and <adj value="closed">blind</adj>.
            <lb/>It was but man, I thought, who <verb value="open">shed</verb>
            <lb/>Laurels upon me: and the rush--
            <lb/>The torrent of the chilly air
            <lb/>Gurgled <prep value="closed">within</prep> my ear the <verb value="closed">crush</verb>
            <lb/>Of empires--with the <noun value="closed">captive</noun>'s prayer--
            <lb/>The hum of suitors--and the tone
            <lb/>Of flattery 'round a sovereign's throne.
        </stanza>

        <stanza>
            <lb/>My passions, from that hapless hour,
            <lb/><verb value="open">Usurped</verb> a <noun value="closed">tyranny</noun> which men
            <lb/>Have deemed since I have reached to power,
            <lb/>My innate nature--be it so:
            <lb/>But, father, there lived one who, then,
            <lb/>Then--<prep value="closed">in</prep> my boyhood--when their fire
            <lb/>Burned with a still intenser <noun value="open">glow</noun>
            <lb/>(For passion must, with youth, <verb value="closed">expire</verb>)
            <lb/>E'en then who knew this iron heart
            <lb/><prep value="closed">In</prep> woman's weakness had a part.
        </stanza>

        <stanza>
            <lb/>I have no words--alas!--to tell
            <lb/>The loveliness of loving well!
            <lb/>Nor would I now attempt to trace
            <lb/>The more than beauty of a face
            <lb/>Whose lineaments, <prep value="open">upon</prep> my mind,
            <lb/>Are--shadows on th' unstable wind:
            <lb/>Thus I remember having dwelt
            <lb/>Some page of early lore <prep value="open">upon</prep>,
            <lb/>With loitering eye, till I have felt
            <lb/>The letters--with their meaning--melt
            <lb/>To fantasies--with none.
        </stanza>

        <stanza>
            <lb/>O, she was worthy of all love!
            <lb/>Love as <prep value="closed">in</prep> infancy was mine--
            <lb/>'Twas such as <noun value="open">angel</noun> minds <prep value="open">above</prep>
            <lb/>Might <verb value="closed">envy</verb>; her young heart the shrine
            <lb/>On which my every hope and thought
            <lb/>Were incense--then a goodly gift,
            <lb/>For they were childish and upright--
            <lb/>Pure--as her young example taught:
            <lb/>Why did I leave it, and, adrift,
            <lb/>Trust to the fire <prep value="closed">within</prep>, for light?
        </stanza>

        <stanza>
            <lb/>We grew <prep value="closed">in</prep> age--and love--together--
            <lb/>Roaming the forest, and the wild;
            <lb/>My breast her shield <prep value="closed">in</prep> wintry weather--
            <lb/>And, when the friendly sunshine smiled.
            <lb/>And she would mark the <adj value="open">opening</adj> skies,
            <lb/>I saw no <noun value="open">Heaven</noun>--but <prep value="closed">in</prep> her eyes.
            <lb/>Young Love's first lesson is----the heart:
            <lb/>For 'mid that sunshine, and those smiles,
            <lb/>When, from our little cares apart,
            <lb/>And laughing at her girlish wiles,
            <lb/>I'd throw me on her throbbing breast,
            <lb/>And pour my spirit <prep value="open">out</prep> <prep value="closed">in</prep> tears--
            <lb/>There was no need to speak the rest--
            <lb/>No need to quiet any fears
            <lb/>Of her--who asked no reason why,
            <lb/>But turned on me her quiet eye!
        </stanza>

        <stanza>
            <lb/>Yet more than worthy of the love
            <lb/>My spirit struggled with, and strove
            <lb/>When, on the <noun value="open">mountain peak</noun>, <adj value="closed">alone</adj>,
            <lb/>Ambition lent it a new tone--
            <lb/>I had no being--but <prep value="closed">in</prep> thee:
            <lb/>The world, and all it did <verb value="closed">contain</verb>
            <lb/><prep value="closed">In</prep> the earth--the air--the sea--
            <lb/>Its joy--its little lot of pain
            <lb/>That was new pleasure--the ideal,
            <lb/>Dim, vanities of dreams by night--
            <lb/>And dimmer nothings which were real--
            <lb/>(Shadows--and a more shadowy light!)
            <lb/><verb value="open">Parted</verb> upon their misty wings,
            <lb/>And, so, confusedly, became
            <lb/>Thine image and--a name--a name!
            <lb/>Two separate--yet most intimate things.
        </stanza>

        <stanza>
            <lb/>I was ambitious--have you known
            <lb/>The passion, father? You have not:
            <lb/>A cottager, I marked a throne
            <lb/>Of half the world as all my own,
            <lb/>And murmured at such <adj value="closed">lowly</adj> lot--
            <lb/>But, just like any other dream,
            <lb/>Upon the vapor of the dew
            <lb/>My own had past, did not the beam
            <lb/>Of beauty which did while it thro'
            <lb/>The minute--the hour--the day--<verb value="closed">oppress</verb>
            <lb/>My mind with double loveliness.

            <lb/>We walked together on the crown

            <lb/>Afar from its proud natural <noun value="open">towers</noun>
            <lb/>Of rock and forest, on the hills--
            <lb/>The dwindled hills! begirt with bowers
            <lb/>And shouting with a thousand rills.
        </stanza>

        <stanza>
            <lb/>I spoke to her of power and pride,
            <lb/>But mystically--<prep value="closed">in</prep> such <noun value="closed">guise</noun>
            <lb/>That she might deem it nought beside
            <lb/>The moment's converse; <prep value="closed">in</prep> her eyes
            <lb/>I read, perhaps too carelessly--
            <lb/>A mingled feeling with my own--
            <lb/>The flush on her bright cheek, to me
            <lb/>Seemed to become a queenly throne
            <lb/>Too well that I should let it be
            <lb/>Light <prep value="closed">in</prep> the wilderness <adj value="closed">alone</adj>.
        </stanza>

            <lb/>I <verb value="closed">wrapped</verb> myself <prep value="closed">in</prep> grandeur then,

            <lb/>Yet it was not that Fantasy
            <lb/>Had thrown her mantle <prep value="open">over</prep> me--
            <lb/>But that, among the rabble--men,
            <lb/>Lion ambition is <verb value="closed">chained</verb> <prep value="closed">down</prep>--
            <lb/>And crouches to a keeper's hand--
            <lb/>Not so <prep value="closed">in</prep> deserts where the grand--
            <lb/>The wild--the terrible <verb value="closed">conspire</verb>
            <lb/>With their own breath to fan his fire.
