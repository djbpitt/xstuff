   <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
   <body>
      <p>
         <work mention="vague">Today I sent a parcel to your address containing 3 small panels and 9 watercolours.</work>
            Please let me know whether you’ve received it. If there’s anything in it you like, so
            much the better. Ma is going on much the same. <work origin="existing" stage="middle">Am still working on various weavers,
            which you’ll get later.</work>
      </p>
      <p>Lies has left again, it’s a lot of hard work for Wil.</p>
      <p>Regards.</p>
