   <salutation>Dear brother,</salutation>
   <body>
      <p>Thanks for your letter and the money.</p>
      <p>Assuming that what you say is true, that <stress reason="family">you started to write to me repeatedly but didn’t
            get round to finishing the letter before — I’m in the same position, since I’ve already
            thrown what I wrote to you into the stove twice — because I found it either too bitter
            or too tame. What shall I say to you?</stress> — your letter sounds very correct to me, and has a
            tone like that of a good Minister for Fine Arts, say.</p>
      <p>But — that doesn’t alter the fact that it isn’t much good to me and it doesn’t satisfy me
            — and above all your ‘perhaps later, once you have expressed yourself more clearly,
            we’ll perhaps also find something in your present work — and then not act as we do
            now’.... fine promise — but — a ministerial fata Morgana — in the eyes of someone like
            me, who would rather find an outlet at a lower level provided it was in the present.</p>
      <p>There you have it — that outlet in the present, with 3rdrate dealers if necessary (not
            from choice) — is something I can’t ask of you in your position — so be it — but you
            can’t ask me to acquiesce in a ministerial fata Morgana, I’m too practical for that,
            after all. Please appreciate that I call you a good minister — and know only too well
            how damned bad the people above the ground floor are as a rule, so I’m very willing to
            treasure a few bright spots, even in the ministerial sphere. <stress reason="career">Which isn’t intransigent,
            and it’s for that reason that I herewith certainly piss on the sacred shrine of the
            intransigents — as I often do — on sacred shrines in general.</stress>
      </p>
      <p>
         <stress reason="money">To business, though — have you ever realized that I presently have more than two guilders
            in expenses daily — reckon 1 for the model, 1 for canvas, paint — it can’t come out any
            cheaper.</stress>
      </p>
      <p>
         <stress reason="money">I still have bills to pay — and — I must go to Antwerp. My position here is rather too
            strained, I’m not comfortable at the moment and I have enough trouble sticking it out
            and ‘possessing my soul in patience’, as they say.</stress>
      </p>
      <p>At home, after all — although there are no real rows — they don’t find the prospect of my
            staying here too long a pleasant one. Which I can well understand. And yet I can’t leave
            — either altogether — or partly (partly if I keep my studio on, which is my plan) unless
            I make a whole lot more studies and — find something new to settle me in Antwerp. Will
            you please bear this in mind? And if you’d do your best to make it rather easier for me
            financially, I believe that then there would be a real chance of keeping the peace
            later, albeit it far from concord. Which I wish for myself and also for others, that
            calmness.</p>
      <p>What is not can yet come, you say, regarding my work — and I, regarding the perception of
            something other than a fata Morgana in your saying ‘later we’ll etc. — (see above)’:
            Today — it’s a fata Morgana to me and I wish, in any event, to try Antwerp. Regards,
            with a handshake.</p>
   </body>
