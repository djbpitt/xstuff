   <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
   <body>
      <p>You’ve so often shown me a glimpse of Paris through your descriptions, this
      time I’m letting you have a look out of my window at the snow-covered yard. I’m adding a
      glimpse of a corner of the house; <work origin="new" stage="sketch">they’re two impressions of the same winter’s day.</work> Poetry
      surrounds us everywhere, but getting it onto paper is something that unfortunately doesn’t go
      as readily as looking. <work origin="new" stage="finished">I did a watercolour of the above after which this scratch is done;</work>
      however, I don’t think it lively or vigorous enough. I believe I’ve already written to you that
      I found a little more natural chalk here in town. I’m also working with that. In my view this
      has been the most real part of this winter, those cold days we had last week. It was mightily
      beautiful with the snow — and curious skies. The melting of the snow today was almost more
      beautiful. But it was typical winter weather, if I may call it that — it was the kind of
      weather that brings back old memories, when the most ordinary things have a look such that one
      instinctively associates them with stories from the age of diligences and mail-coaches.</p>
      <p>
         <work origin="new" stage="sketch">Here’s
      a scratch, for example,</work> that I did in that kind of daydream. It shows a gentleman who has had
      to spend the night at a village inn due to the late arrival of a diligence or some such
      reason. Now he has risen early, and while he orders a glass of brandy for the cold he pays the
      innkeeper’s wife (a woman with a peasant’s cap). But it’s still very early in the morning,
      ‘the crack of dawn’, — he must catch the mail-coach — the moon is still shining and the
      glistening snow can be seen through the window of the taproom — and the objects cast oddly
      whimsical shadows. This story is really nothing at all, and the scratch is nothing too, but
      from one thing and another you’ll perhaps understand what I mean, namely that of late
      everything had a je ne sais quoi that made one feel like scribbling it down on paper. In
      short, the whole of nature is an inexpressibly beautiful Black and White exhibition when there
      are those snow effects. <work origin="new" stage="sketch">Now I’m doing scratches anyway, I’m adding a very superficial one of a
      drawing in natural chalk, the girl at the cradle, done in the same way as the woman and the
      child you wrote about.</work> This natural chalk really is odd stuff. The other scratch of a skipper
      is after a drawing which has a lot of washes with neutral tint and sepia. It wouldn’t surprise
      me in the least if the little I’ve sent you recently struck you as being a rather meagre
      result.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I believe it could hardly be otherwise. There’s something fated about it: that
      in order to see the singularity of the work in Black and White, one must always take the whole
      into account, and it’s impossible to do so all the time. I mean, there’s a certain difference
      between making 10 drawings and making 100 drawings or sketches or studies. Not, to be sure,
      because of the quantity — leave the quantity aside — but what I want to say is this: in Black
      and White there’s a certain mildness which enables one to draw one and the same figure that
      one finds beautiful in perhaps 10 different poses, whereas with watercolour, say, or if one
      painted it, one would do it in only one pose. Now assume that in this 10 there are 9 bad ones.
      I sincerely hope the ratio of good to bad won’t always be like this, but let’s assume for now
      that it is. If you yourself were to be at the studio now, I don’t think a week would pass
      without me presenting you with not one but a certain number of studies — and it would amaze me
      if you couldn’t always pick out from that certain number one or two things in which you found
      something attractive. While that wouldn’t mean that the rest had been done for nothing, since
      studies that fail in some respects turn out one day to have a purpose and to be of use for
      some new composition after all. So for this reason I believe that when you come here again
      you’ll find certain things about which you can probably give me some tips.</p>
      <p>So, for example,
      for me, who doesn’t have even the slightest knowledge of Lhermitte’s drawings (you know I did
      enquire about them) and does know Cicéri’s watercolours as well as his old lithographic
      drawing examples, but nothing at all of his present drawings in black and white — so, as I
      say, it’s rather difficult for me to understand exactly what you mean when you wrote about a
      certain scratch: ‘Couldn’t you do something that would be somewhat on the lines of the
      drawings mentioned?’ I’m sure that both those artists are infinitely more advanced than I am —
      but still, that idea of yours might be feasible — I believe I’ll learn things myself, won’t I?
      And it won’t be an impossibility. And I wanted to say this to you again — in my view the
      position is that once I’ve managed to make something suitable for that purpose, there’s a
      certain mildness in Black and White that would enable someone to be highly productive in that
      direction once found. Not without continuous labour, of course, but I face that now anyway. <work origin="existing" stage="finished">So
      should it be that the drawings in natural chalk I sent you aren’t what you intended,</work> even
      though I had your tip in mind when I did them, don’t let that discourage you, and feel at
      liberty to come back to that point, the more often the better. And be assured that once I’ve
      grasped your intention I’ll be prepared, for example, to do as I said above — and do 10 of
      them to get one good one.</p>
      <p>Anyway, when you come to the studio sometime, I believe you’ll see
      that I have a certain level of activity, and I hope you’ll continue to see me in that way,
      won’t you?, and that you also understand that, although someone with a certain level of
      activity, even if it’s for himself — or rather without his work having an immediate
      destination — is nonetheless working, it would be doubly encouraging if one could find a
      destination. This also applies to possible work for illustrated magazines. These past few days
      I’ve been re-reading ‘Gedroogde kruiden’ by Fritz Reuter with enormous pleasure. It’s just
      like Knaus or Vautier, say. Do you know a draughtsman called Régamey? His work has great
      character, I have woodcuts by him, among them drawings done in prison — and Gypsies and
      Japanese. When you come you must see my woodcuts again. I’ve got some new ones since last
      time. It seemed to you perhaps as if the sun shone brighter and everything had acquired a new
      charm.</p>
      <p>At any rate, I believe this is always the effect of a serious love, and that’s a
      delightful thing. And I believe those who say that one doesn’t think clearly then are
      mistaken, for it’s then that one thinks very clearly and does more than otherwise. And love is
      something eternal, it changes its aspect but not its foundation. And there’s the same
      difference between someone who loves and the same man before as between a lamp that is lit and
      one that isn’t. The lamp was there and was a good lamp, but now it gives light as well and has
      its proper function. And one becomes calmer regarding many things, and precisely because of
      that one is more fit for one’s work. I can find no words for how beautiful the old courtyards
      are here. And although Israëls does it perfectly, so to speak, I find it strange that so
      relatively few pay them any attention. Here in The Hague every day, so to speak, I see a world
      which a great many pass by and which is very different from what most are making. And wouldn’t
      dare say this if I hadn’t had the experience of figure painters actually passing it by as
      well, and remembered walking with them and, when I was struck by this or that figure we
      encountered, hearing repeatedly ‘Oh, but those filthy folk’ or ‘that sort of people’ — in
      short, expressions one wouldn’t expect from a painter. Yes, that sometimes made me stop and
      think. I remember, among others, a conversation with Henkes, who often saw and sees so well,
      which absolutely astonished me. It’s just as if they deliberately avoid the most serious, the
      most beautiful, in short, voluntarily muzzle themselves and clip their wings. And while I
      gradually gain more respect for some, with others I can’t help thinking that they’ll lapse
      into sterility if they carry on in the same way. And the old Bohème was very strong on exactly
      that point, that it was productive. And — and some say la Bohème is no good, but be careful,
      there are some who want to grab every last bit in the barrel and — and — and will get the lid
      on their nose. Put out the candle — so be it — but it will bring no good to snuff it out
      prematurely.</p>
