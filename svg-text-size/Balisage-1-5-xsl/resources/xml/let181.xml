   <body>
      <p>How you took my two previous letters isn’t yet apparent to me from your letter of today to Pa
      and Ma. Precisely because you neither enclosed a letter for me nor mentioned receiving my
      letters, I take it that I’ll soon be getting a letter from you. And in the circumstances I’d
      much rather that you write to me after reading both of my letters, or, this one included, all
      three of them, which supplement one another and don’t stand alone, than that you’d have
      immediately answered only the first one alone. How cold and harsh my first letter must have
      sounded, and you undoubtedly thought then that I was already very callous and hardened. But
      was it wrong of me? And will you think badly of me for not immediately revealing my more
      tender and intimate feelings, since they would have found you, O man of business! in the fever
      of daily affairs, which is not exactly the mood to appreciate love stories. So I thought
      something along the lines of: no, first we’ll wake him up and only then will we sow softer
      words in His Hon. We’ll plough him first, this man who ‘deftly dispatches business’. That’s
      why the first letter was as cold as a ploughshare. But as to the second, was I wrong in
      claiming that it would be more serious and intimate? And now that we’ve begun to talk more
      intimately, we want to go on doing so. But ‘meanwhile’ – a bit more ploughshare. It begins
      here. Although you’ve come a long way without a ‘she and no other’, although you stand firm in
      your shoes without a she and no other, although you deftly dispatch business without a she and
      no other, although you are a man of willpower, energy and character without a she and no
      other, although you’ve gained human understanding and experience without a she and no other,
      although you possess cheerfulness and high spirits and courage without a she and no other,
      although you dare to choose sides and loathe vacillation without.... Nevertheless, you would
      go much further, stand firmer in your shoes, dispatch business more deftly, be more a man of
      willpower, energy and character, gain more human understanding and experience, possess more
      cheerfulness, high spirits and courage, choose sides more resolutely, be even more loathful of
      vacillation, hesitation, doubt &amp;c. than you have been thus far, when you’ll have found
      someone suited to being your ‘she and no other’. In short, you’ll be more yourself, happier
      and better, with an honestly meant and deeply felt ‘she and no other’ than without the same. </p>
      <p>The bit of ploughshare continues — don’t let it anger you! Your letter to Pa and Ma was so
      gloomy in a way, and to tell you the honest truth I couldn’t make head or tail of it and don’t
      know what to think. Is there anything serious or not? And some of the things you said amazed
      me, first of all because it was you saying them, and second because you said them to Pa and
      Ma. After all, it’s you more than anyone who keep all your great and petty miseries of human
      life to yourself, and if you chance to voice them it is to those whom you know to be strong in
      whatever it is that might be making you feel vulnerable. In short, I think that when you feel
      insecure about something, you confess that insecurity only to someone you know can cure you of
      it. Indeed, just this summer you yourself told me that you considered it better not to speak
      of life’s difficulties but thought it better to keep them to yourself in order, you said, not
      to lose your resilience. I found such strength of mind very impressive, even though I was far
      from sympathizing and am aware that all too often my need for sympathy has tempted me to seek
      it from those who, instead of bolstering me up, tended rather to weaken my resolve. Pa and Ma
      are really good, but they have little idea of one’s actual state of mind and the actual
      circumstances of either you or me. They love us, especially you, with all their heart, and at
      bottom we, you and I both, love them truly. But alas! In many cases they cannot give us
      practical advice, and there are instances when they don’t understand us, no matter how hard
      they try. It’s not that they or we are to blame as much as the difference in age and a
      different way of thinking, the difference in circumstances. I do believe, Theo, that no matter
      how great the love you and Pa and Ma feel for one another, they nevertheless imagine you to be
      very different from what you really are. And I think that you and I would do better to talk
      about business as well as about more intimate affairs of the heart with people like Mr
      Tersteeg and Mauve, for instance, than with Pa and Ma. Is the ploughshare very cold and sharp
      — old boy? </p>
      <p>I say this from my own experience. Still, I don’t mean to say that we should hide our hearts’
      secrets from Pa and Ma and not give them our trust. God forbid. It’s also not my opinion that
      Pa and Ma’s advice is wrong or silly. God forbid that too. But we shouldn’t expect from them
      such practical and such indispensable advice as others would perhaps be able to give us (Mr T.
      and M., for instance) who understand more from half a word than Pa and Ma from a careful
      explanation. I consider it possible that I’m wrong about this, but think about it and share
      your thoughts on the matter with me, if you will. But — that our home is and will continue to
      be our refuge, come what may, and we do well to appreciate this and are obliged for our part
      to honour that home — I agree with you entirely on that score, though you probably didn’t
      expect such a frank declaration from me. Even so, there’s a refuge that is better, more
      necessary, more indispensable than our home with Pa and Ma, no matter how good, how necessary,
      how indispensable that may be, and that is our own hearth and home with our respective ‘she
      and no other’. So then, O man of business, who dispatches business deftly, behold your
      greatest business affair, your own home with your own ‘she and no other’. Behold, in my view,
      the point which you do well to keep sight of, the remedy which, more than any other ‘tonic’,
      will stimulate and renew more and more every day your courage to face life, your high spirits,
      your vigour and energy. Several things you said in your letter of today now make me say:
      Suppose there were a special reason for you to be more than ever on the qui vive and to act
      forcefully and intelligently, suppose someone were trying to undermine you and there were some
      trouble or predicament, don’t forget that you’re 26 years old and in ‘the prime of life’.
      Strike the best blow you’ve ever struck! Thoroughly renew yourself! By being especially on the
      qui vive in the sense that you look at girls somewhat more seriously and observantly, and see
      for once whether your ‘she and no other’ isn’t among them. Here ends the ploughshare. </p>
      <p>Perhaps you remember that we talked this summer about the question of women, both with a kind
      of despondency. That we felt, or thought we felt, something like, Woman is the desolation of
      the righteous man. And — and — I and possibly you too, at least a little bit, were in our view
      ‘the Mr Righteous in question’. Whether the above words are true or not I’m in no position to
      say, because since this summer I’ve begun to doubt if I actually knew then, first ‘what a
      woman is’, and second ‘what a righteous man is’. And I set out to examine both questions more
      closely, the result of such examination being that now I often say to myself, You don’t yet
      know what a woman is, you don’t yet know what a righteous man is, except that you aren’t yet
      such a one.</p>
      <p>Which is completely different from my frame of mind this summer. Not I but père Michelet says
      to all young men like you and me, ‘a woman must breathe upon you if you’re to be a man’. She
      has breathed upon me, my dear chap! What do you mean? Because three times she has answered
      ‘never’. That, my dear chap, is one of their ways of breathing upon a monster, and there’s the
      monster who turns into a man! For love of her! She and no other! Do you understand, my dear
      chap? In the same way and conversely must ‘a man breathe upon a woman if she is to be a
      woman’? I think so very certainly. If you ask me, How to breathe on her? Here’s my clear and
      simple answer, By setting against her ‘never’ these other words, ‘my dear, I love you and you
      will love me, may God help us’. One must have loved, and have fallen out of love, and love on!
      Do you understand, my dear chap? No! where is thy sting? Never, where is thy victory! To love
      again, it is God’s will! Do you understand ─ my dear chap? </p>
      <p>Behold, therefore, a love story for you, man of business! Do you think it very tedious and
      very sentimental? Once I’d firmly resolved neither to leave her nor to return from following
      after her, even if this might incur her displeasure at first, once I clung simply and solely
      to the ‘she and no other’ and the ‘love on’, then I felt a certain calm and determination.
      Then my despondency also disappeared, then all things became new for me, then, too, my
      physical energy increased. And even though I haven’t yet come to the end of the no, nay,
      never, and unfortunately therefore am to this day a soul in need, <stress reason="career">I still consider my conduct
      unregrettable</stress>. By this I don’t mean to say that I did not, do not or will not do any clumsy,
      awkward things, but that the mistakes I did make, am making and will yet make don’t alter the
      fact that there’s a straight path before me upon which I walk, and that the ‘she and no other’
      and the ‘love on’ are principles which I do well to adhere to. There are, however, those who
      think that I ought to have resigned myself and think that it goes ‘against the rules’ not to
      consider myself defeated, but if one says of my declaration of this summer, ‘the cat gets the
      birds who sing too soon’, then you know the verse, </p>
      <p>Indeed, he lost feathers galore, But what, my fine sirs, was in store? They grew better than
      ever before.</p>
      <p>And as for ‘the rejection’ I got this summer, I’d be ashamed if I hadn’t got it. I won’t
      trade it for ‘no rejection’ (it was suggested that I view it as ‘not having happened’, but I
      said ‘it did happen’) in the sense of ‘not having happened’, but only for ‘no rejection’ in
      the sense of ‘love on’! </p>
      <p>Now, however, it’s <stress reason="love"> ‘a petty misery of human life’</stress> for me that I can’t even occasionally visit
      her or write to her, and that those who, with me, might exert a wholesome influence on the
      undermining or bankrupting of that ‘no, nay, never’ instead rather too readily bring grist to
      the mill of ‘no, nay, never’. I would that she found no sympathy, anywhere or from anyone, for
      her ‘no, nay, never’, and that all would combine their efforts culpably to bankrupt that ‘no,
      nay, never’. In short, to reduce it once and for all to a monument, warning other
      no-nay-never-saying ladies and encouraging those who say ‘love on’. But we haven’t reached
      that point yet; but you, you Theo, don’t be for the ‘no, nay, never’ but instead for the ‘love
      on’! I’d think it very decent of you if, for example, you were to find a way of persuading Pa
      and Ma,<stress reason="family"> who are extremely pessimistic about this and call what I did this summer ‘untimely’
      and ‘indelicate’</stress> (until I begged them very decidedly and definitely, after first having used
      more temperate reasoning in vain, no longer to apply such expressions to this love of mine,
      because otherwise I would be forced, proud as a lion, to go against them), I should, I say,
      think it very decent of you if you were to move them to less pessimism and more good courage
      and humanity. A word from you probably has more influence on them than anything I could say,
      and it would be so good, both for them and for me, if, instead of trying to thwart me in my
      progress, they let me quietly proceed.</p>
      <p>They would, for instance, like me to break off all correspondence whatsoever with Uncle and
      Aunt Stricker. Naturally I can’t promise anything of the kind, and even if I were to cut off
      my correspondence with them for a while, I’d only take it up again afterwards with renewed
      vigour. She doesn’t want to read my letters but — but — but — the frost and winter cold is all
      too bitter to last for long. I find it much healthier and more natural that, when I first
      spoke to her of these things, she responded so very energetically with that ‘no, nay, never’.
      Precisely that — gives me the assurance that there existed some fatal condition and the hope
      that I’ve touched upon the very heart of that condition of wrapping oneself up in the past too
      much. Now there follows a crisis of indignation, but the operating surgeon laughs up his
      sleeve and says ‘touché’. Between you and me! Let this be between you and me! Listen, Theo,
      she mustn’t find out that I’m laughing up my sleeve about the result of the lancet’s cut. I’m
      rather repentant towards her, of course. ‘Have I hurt you? Oh, how coarse and hard I’ve been!
      How could I have been like that?’ That’s my attitude towards her. Very contrite and humble
      letter to Uncle Stricker, but nonetheless said ‘she and no other’ to His Hon. You won’t betray
      me, brother! Viewing what has happened as not having happened, that’s nothing but nonsense and
      humbug. I’ll have none of it. Old chap, I’m so happy about ‘that rejection’, I’d really like
      to shout it to the skies, but I have to keep quiet. And attack her again in some way or other.
      But how to approach her? How to get near her? Some time or other, very unexpectedly and
      unforeseen. Because if I don’t stick to my guns, that fatal condition of wrapping oneself up
      in the past too much will return seven times stronger, and the matter of ‘love on’ is indeed
      such a good thing and surely worth surrendering one’s soul to. </p>
      <p>Well,<stress reason="family"> I’ve grumbled a bit about Pa and Ma</stress>, but except that <stress reason="family">they really don’t have the
      remotest idea of how matters stand</stress>, and understand nothing of the ‘love on’, and could think
      of nothing else to say than untimely and indelicate until I stopped them, they are very good
      to me, and kinder than ever. But I would rather that they had a little more understanding of
      my thoughts and view of things. They think along the lines of a kind of resignation strategy
      regarding many things to which I cannot resign myself. Well, a letter from you making light of
      the no, nay, never would possibly prove very effective. This summer, for instance, a single
      word from Ma would have given me the opportunity to say many things to her that couldn’t be
      said in public. She resolutely refused to say that word, however; instead, she cut short my
      opportunity. And came to me with a face full of pity and all kinds of consoling words, and
      without doubt she said a very nice prayer for me that would have granted me the strength to
      resign myself anyway. But until now that prayer has gone unanswered, and instead I’ve been
      given the strength to act. You understand that someone who wants to act cannot entirely
      approve of his mother praying for resignation for him. And also finds her consoling words
      slightly misplaced, so long as he doesn’t despair but says from the bottom of his heart, </p>
      <p>
         <stress reason="environment">I do not accept the yoke of despair</stress>. I would that she hadn’t prayed for me but had given me
      the opportunity for an intimate conversation with her. Furthermore, instead of bringing grist
      to the mill of no, nay, never, she could have looked after my interests, when Kee spoke
      confidentially to her and poured her heart out, and instead of going along with no, nay,
      never, she could have said ‘love on’. I tell you these things to prove that an energetic ‘love
      on’! from you, directed at Pa and Ma, would be doing me a true kindness. For I’m right in
      thinking, am I not, brother, that we aren’t just brothers but also friends and kindred
      spirits, especially with respect to Love on? Adieu, write soon, a handshake in thought,
      believe me </p>

      <p>Since I love ‘in reality’ there’s also more reality in my drawings, and I’m now sitting in
      the little room, writing to you with a whole collection of men, women, children from Het Heike
      &amp;c. all around me. Mauve is ill, but Pa and Ma have asked him to come here and get well as
      soon as he can make the journey. </p>
