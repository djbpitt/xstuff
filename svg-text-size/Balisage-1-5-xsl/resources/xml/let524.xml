   <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
   <body>
      <p>
         <stress reason="family">What very much distresses me in our conversation is that when I say that I fear it will be
      tight for you this year, you reply: ‘that you observe that I’d like to see that’, ‘that you
      see very well that you can’t rely on me’, ‘that you know very well that I would be returning
      you no thanks for your pains’. This is not so, and it distresses me that this is how you see
      it.</stress>
         <stress reason="money"/>
      </p>
      <p>My suggestion has been this — don’t regard my little painting business as dead weight and
      don’t treat it harshly, for the reason that it could prove to be a little boat in a disaster
      when the big ship is lost. My suggestion is and remains — let’s at any rate keep that little
      boat in good condition and ready to sail, whether the storm comes or my anxiety proves to be
      unfounded. At the moment I’m a little vessel which you have in tow and once in a while can
      only seem to you to be dead weight. Which, by the way — as dead weight — you can leave behind
      by cutting the rope if you want to. But in this case I, who am the skipper of my small craft,
      ask that far from having the towrope cut, my little craft should be caulked and provisioned so
      that it may do better service in time of need.</p>
      <p>Should you doubt the good faith of this request, then for my part I can do nothing but repeat
      it more emphatically. <stress reason="money">For I notice that on the side of the paint bill, my own little craft is
      springing leaks here and there.</stress>
      </p>
      <p>
         <good_health>I’m plugging these leaks as much as I can, though, and am not yet losing my coolheadedness.
      Am not desperate either.</good_health> But since we’ll perhaps both be in the same storm, I speak
      emphatically and, I believe, in both our interests.</p>
      <p>I can sum up your answer to my question thus: ‘there may be a storm coming but, even in that
      case, don’t count on either caulking or provisions, and be aware that I may be compelled by
      the force of circumstances to cut the towrope’.I can take this answer as a warning, but only
      in so far as it’s not accompanied by suspicion of my good faith.</p>
      <p>But — by means of this letter I cry out to you again that my request for reinforcement may
      prove to be in both our interests, and I’m not doing it just out of selfishness, as you
      assume. <stress reason="money">That in the event of a storm, I in all events am willing but perhaps also able to be
      of some use and service to you, but that this will be impossible in the event that my own
      craft fills with water (which I’m trying to prevent, though) before the moment in question.
      I’m trying to prevent that myself, though, but still I wouldn’t cry out to you without
      necessity. I’m not afraid in the face of danger either, but nonetheless I try to be prepared
      in case disaster strikes.</stress>
      </p>
      <p>If it seems to you unfounded that I urge that we should gradually let my, but I would rather
      say our little painting business become the heart of a business that we could go on to
      undertake together, <unstress reason="career">for my part I insist that it can and will become something if we can
      remain sufficiently united.</unstress>If I don’t have the same ideas as you, don’t suspect me of bad
      faith or base intentions anyway, either towards you or towards those at home. I do nothing to
      those at home that I have no right to do, since I absolutely and always keep out of their
      affairs. Don’t ask for or urge advice, keep entirely to my own territory — and even keep my
      feelings about their affairs to myself too, since we don’t understand one another’s interests
      anyway.</p>
      <p>And to you I speak now, and will go on speaking, as someone whose business is in paintings to
      someone else whose business is in paintings, and I will not intrude on the other
      territory.</p>
      <p>And the question that I started to discuss with you is this: even if the slump is severe, and
      even if we both have to take great trouble, we must see to it that we keep an energetic hand
      on the little painting business that belongs to you as well as to me. I say, it might be a
      boat that could possibly be of service to you in the storm, although I wish for the storm as
      little as you can wish for it.</p>
