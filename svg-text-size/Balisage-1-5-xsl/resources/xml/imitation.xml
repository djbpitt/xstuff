    <stanza>
        <lb/>A <adj value="closed">dark</adj> unfathomed tide
        <lb/>Of interminable prideâ€”
        <lb/>A <noun value="closed">mystery</noun>, and a dream,
        <lb/>Should my early life seem;
        <lb/>I say that dream was <adj value="closed">fraught</adj>
        <lb/>With a <adj value="open">wild</adj> and <noun value="open">waking</noun> thought
        <lb/>Of beings that have been,
        <lb/>Which my spirit hath not seen,
        <lb/>Had I let them pass me by,
        <lb/>With a dreaming eye!
        <lb/>Let none of earth inherit
        <lb/>That vision on my spirit;
        <lb/>Those thoughts I would <verb value="closed">control</verb>,
        <lb/>As a spell <prep value="closed">upon</prep> his soul:
        <lb/>For that bright hope at last
        <lb/>And that light time have past,
        <lb/>And my wordly <noun value="closed">rest</noun> hath gone
        <lb/>With a sigh as it passed on:
        <lb/>I care not though it <verb value="closed">perish</verb>
        <lb/>With a thought I then did <verb value="open">cherish</verb>.
