        <title>ROMANCE</title>
    </meta>
    <stanza>
        <lb/>Romance, who loves to nod and sing
        <lb/>With drowsy head and <verb value="closed">folded</verb> wing
        <lb/>Among the green leaves as they shake
        <lb/>Far <adv value="closed">down</adv> <prep value="closed">within</prep> some shadowy lake,
        <lb/>To me a painted <foreign lang="fr">paroquet</foreign>
        <lb/>Hath been—a most familiar bird—
        <lb/>Taught me my alphabet to say,
        <lb/>To lisp my very earliest word
        <lb/>While in the wild-wood I did <verb value="closed">lie</verb>,
        <lb/>A child—with a most knowing eye.
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
        <lb/>Of late, eternal <foreign lang="sp">condor</foreign> years
        <lb/>So shake the very <noun value="open">heaven</noun> on high
        <lb/>With <foreign lang="latin">tumult</foreign> as they thunder by,
        <lb/>I have no time for idle cares
        <lb/>Through gazing on the unquiet sky;
        <lb/>And when an hour with calmer wings
        <lb/>Its <adv value="closed">down</adv> upon my spirit <verb value="closed">flings</verb>,
        <lb/>That little time with lyre and rhyme
        <lb/>To while away—<adj value="closed">forbidden</adj> things—
        <lb/>My heart would feel to be a crime
        <lb/>Unless it trembled with the strings.
    </stanza>
