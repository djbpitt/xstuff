<poem><meta><title>The Forest Reverie</title></meta>

<stanza><lb/>'Tis said that when
<lb/>The hands of men
<lb/>Tamed this primeval wood, 
<lb/>And hoary trees with groans of wo, 
<lb/>Like warriors by an unknown foe,
<lb/>Were in their strength <verb value="closed">subdued</verb>,
<lb/>The virgin Earth
<lb/>Gave instant <noun value="open">birth</noun>
<lb/>To <noun value="open">springs</noun> that ne'er did <verb value="open">flow</verb>—
<lb/>That <prep value="closed">in</prep> the <noun value="open">sun</noun>
<lb/>Did rivulets run, 
<lb/>And all around rare flowers did blow—
<lb/>The wild rose pale
<lb/>Perfumed the gale, 
<lb/>And the queenly lily adown the dale
<lb/>(Whom the <noun value="open">sun</noun> and the dew
<lb/>And the winds did woo), 
<lb/>With the gourd and the grape luxuriant <verb value="open">grew</verb>.</stanza> 
<stanza><lb/>So when in tears
<lb/>The love of years
<lb/>Is wasted like the snow,
<lb/>And the fine fibrils of its <noun value="open">life</noun>
<lb/>By the rude wrong of instant strife
<lb/>Are broken at a blow—
<lb/><prep value="closed">Within</prep> the heart
<lb/>Do springs upstart 
<lb/>Of which it doth now know,
<lb/>And strange, sweet dreams,
<lb/>Like <adj value="closed">silent</adj> streams
<lb/>That from new fountains <verb value="open">overflow</verb>,
<lb/>With the earlier <noun value="open">tide</noun>
<lb/>Of <noun value="open">rivers</noun> glide 
<lb/><adj value="closed">Deep</adj> <prep value="closed">in</prep> the heart whose hope has <verb value="closed">died</verb>—
<lb/>Quenching the fires its ashes <verb value="closed">hide</verb>,—
<lb/>Its ashes, whence will <verb value="open">spring</verb> and <verb value="open">grow</verb> 
<lb/>Sweet flowers, ere long,—
<lb/>The rare and <adj value="open">radiant</adj> flowers of song!</stanza></poem>
