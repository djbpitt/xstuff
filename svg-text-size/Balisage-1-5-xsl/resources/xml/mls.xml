    <stanza>
        <lb/>Of all who hail thy presence as the morning;
        <lb/>Of all to whom thine absence is the night,
        <lb/>The <verb value="closed">blotting</verb> utterly from out <adj value="open">high</adj> <ref value="biblical">heaven</ref>
        <lb/>The sacred sun; of all who, weeping, bless thee
        <lb/>Hourly for hope, for life, ah! <prep value="open">above</prep> all,
        <lb/>For the resurrection of <verb value="closed">deep-buried</verb> faith
        <lb/>In truth, in virtue, in humanity;
        <lb/>Of all who, on despair's <foreign lang="deu">unhallowed</foreign> bed
        <lb/><verb value="closed">Lying</verb> <adv value="closed">down</adv> to die, have suddenly arisen
        <lb/>At thy soft-murmured words, "Let there be light!"
        <lb/>At the soft-murmured words that were fulfilled
        <lb/>In the <foreign lang="hebrew">seraphic</foreign> glancing of thine eyes;
        <lb/>Of all who owe thee most, whose gratitude
        <lb/>Nearest resembles worship, oh, remember
        <lb/>The truest, the most fervently devoted,
        <lb/>And think that these <adj value="closed">weak</adj> lines are written by him:
        <lb/>By him, who, as he pens them, thrills to think
        <lb/>His spirit is communing with an <ref value="biblical">angel's</ref>.
