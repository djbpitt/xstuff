        <title>TO SCIENCE
            A PROLOGUE TO "AL AARAAF"</title>
    </meta>
    <stanza>
        <lb/>Science! true daughter of Old Time thou art,
        <lb/>Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes.
        <lb/>Why <verb value="closed">preyest</verb> thou thus <prep value="closed">upon</prep> the poet's heart,
        <lb/>Vulture, whose wings are dull realities?
        <lb/>How should he love thee? or how deem thee wise,
        <lb/>Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering
        <lb/>To seek for treasure in the jewelled <noun value="open">skies</noun>,
        <lb/>Albeit he <verb value="open">soared</verb> with an undaunted wing?
        <lb/>Hast thou not <verb value="closed">dragged</verb> Diana from her car,
        <lb/>And driven the Hamadryad from the wood
        <lb/>To seek a <noun value="closed">shelter</noun> in some happier star?
        <lb/>Hast thou not <verb value="open">torn</verb> the Naiad from her flood,
        <lb/>The Elfin from the green grass, and from me
        <lb/>The summer dream <prep value="closed">beneath</prep> the tamarind-tree?
