        <title>TO MY MOTHER</title>
        <date>1849</date>

        <stanza>
            <lb/>Because I feel that, <prep value="closed">in</prep> the <noun value="open">Heavens</noun> <prep value="open">above</prep>,
            <lb/>The <noun value="open">angels</noun>, whispering <prep value="closed">to</prep> one another,
            <lb/>Can <verb value="open">find</verb>, among their burning terms of love,
            <lb/>None so devotional as that of "Mother,"
            <lb/>Therefore by that dear name I long have called you--
            <lb/>You who are more than mother <prep value="closed">unto</prep> me,
            <lb/>And <verb value="closed">fill</verb> my heart of hearts, where <noun value="closed">Death</noun> <verb value="closed">installed</verb> you,
            <lb/><prep value="closed">In</prep> <verb value="closed">setting</verb> my Virginia's <noun value="open">spirit</noun> <adj value="open">free</adj>.
            <lb/>My mother--my own mother, who <verb value="closed">died</verb> early,
            <lb/>Was but the mother of myself; but you
            <lb/>Are mother <prep value="closed">to</prep> the one I loved so dearly,
            <lb/>And thus are dearer than the mother I knew
            <lb/>By that <noun value="open">infinity</noun> with which my wife
            <lb/>Was dearer to my <noun value="open">soul</noun> than its <noun value="open">soul-life</noun>.
