        <stanza>
            <lb/>For her this rhyme is penned, whose luminous eyes,
            <lb/>Brightly <adj value="closed">expressive</adj> as the twins of <ref value="myth">Leda</ref>,
            <lb/>Shall <verb value="closed">find</verb> her own sweet name, that, nestling <verb value="open">lies</verb>
            <lb/><prep value="closed">Upon</prep> the page, <verb value="open">enwrapped</verb> from every reader.
            <lb/>Search narrowly the lbs!--they <verb value="open">hold</verb> a treasure
            <lb/>Divine--a talisman--an amulet
            <lb/>That must be worn at heart. Search well the measure--
            <lb/>The words--the syllables! Do not forget
            <lb/>The trivialest point, or you may <verb value="closed">lose</verb> your labor!
            <lb/>And yet there is <prep value="open">in</prep> this no Gordian <noun value="open">knot</noun>
            <lb/>Which one might not <verb value="closed">undo</verb> <prep value="closed">without</prep> a sabre,
            <lb/>If one could merely comprehend the plot.
            <lb/>Enwritten <prep value="closed">upon</prep> the leaf where now are peering
            <lb/>Eyes scintillating <noun value="closed">soul</noun>, there <verb value="open">lie</verb> <adv value="open">perdus</adv>
            <lb/>Three eloquent words oft uttered <prep value="open">in</prep> the hearing
            <lb/>Of poets by poets--as the name is a poet's, too.
            <lb/>Its letters, although naturally <verb value="open">lying</verb>
            <lb/>Like the knight <ref value="historical">Pinto--Mendez Ferdinando</ref>--
            <lb/>Still form a synonym for Truth--<verb value="open">Cease</verb> trying!
            <lb/>You will not read the riddle, though you do the best you can do.
