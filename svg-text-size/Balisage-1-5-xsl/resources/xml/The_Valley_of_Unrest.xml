        <title>THE VALLEY OF UNREST</title>

        <stanza>
            <lb/>Once it smiled a silent dell
            <lb/>Where the people did not dwell;
            <lb/>They had <verb value="closed">gone</verb> unto the wars,
            <lb/>Trusting to the mild-eyed stars,
            <lb/>Nightly, from their azure <noun value="closed">towers</noun>,
            <lb/>To keep watch <prep value="open">above</prep> the flowers,
            <lb/><prep value="closed">In</prep> the midst of which all day
            <lb/>The red sun-light lazily lay,
            <lb/>Now each visitor shall <verb value="open">confess</verb>
            <lb/>The sad <noun value="closed">valley</noun>'s restlessness.
            <lb/>Nothing there is motionless--
            <lb/>Nothing save the airs that <verb value="closed">brood</verb>
            <lb/><prep value="open">Over</prep> the magic <noun value="closed">solitude</noun>.
            <lb/>Ah, by no wind are stirred those trees
            <lb/>That palpitate like the chill seas
            <lb/>Around the misty <ref value="location">Hebrides</ref>!
            <lb/>Ah, by no wind those clouds are <verb value="closed">driven</verb>
            <lb/>That rustle through the unquiet <noun value="open">Heaven</noun>
            <lb/><adv value="closed">Unceasingly</adv>, from morn till even,
            <lb/><prep value="open">Over</prep> the violets there that <verb value="closed">lie</verb>
            <lb/><prep value="closed">In</prep> myriad types of the human eye--
            <lb/><prep value="open">Over</prep> the lilies that wave
            <lb/>And weep above a nameless <noun value="closed">grave</noun>!
            <lb/>They wave:--from <prep value="open">out</prep> their fragrant tops
            <lb/><adj value="open">Eternal</adj> dews come <prep value="closed">down</prep> in drops.
            <lb/>They weep:--from <prep value="open">off</prep> their delicate stems
            <lb/>Perennial tears <verb value="closed">descend</verb> in gems.
