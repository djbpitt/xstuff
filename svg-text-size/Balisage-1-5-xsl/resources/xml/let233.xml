   <salutation>My dear brother, </salutation>
   <body>
      <p>To day or tomorrow/ being the 1st of June/ I promised to pay my landlord f_ 5. rent of
            studio for the month of April + f_ 7.50 for last month – makes f_ 12.50. <stress reason="money">But not having
            up to now received any letter of yours since that of May 12th I have nothing to pay him
            his twelve guilders &amp; 50c with</stress>_ The man will surely not give me any longer delay but
            they can immediately sell my furniture publicly. <stress reason="friendship">Whatever may be your opinion concerning
            the things I told you – do not let it come to this scandal. </stress>
         <work origin="existing" stage="finished">My drawings for C.M. </work>are
            ready<stress reason="money"> but I shall not be able to get that money early enough</stress>. I say again – let us at
            all events avoid irregularity &amp; public scandal and talk or write calmly on the
            subject till we know what ought to be done. Therefore I hope you will sent me what I so
            greatly want/ &amp; write. I work day &amp; night &amp;<work origin="new" stage="finished"> have a small drawing ready for
            you</work> which I will send bye &amp; bye. <stress reason="money">I have no more money for a stamp, excuse the
            postcard, &amp; believe me</stress>
      </p>
