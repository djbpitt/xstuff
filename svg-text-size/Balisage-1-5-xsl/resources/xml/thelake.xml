        <title>The Lake</title>
        <date>1827</date>

    <stanza>
        <lb/>In spring of youth it was my lot
        <lb/>To <verb value="closed">haunt</verb> of the wide world a spot
        <lb/>The which I could not love the less—
        <lb/>So lovely was the <adj value="closed">loneliness</adj>
        <lb/>Of a wild lake, with black rock <verb value="closed">bound</verb>,
        <lb/>And the <adj value="open">tall</adj> pines that <verb value="open">towered</verb> <adv value="closed">around</adv>.
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
        <lb/>But when the Night had thrown her pall
        <lb/><prep value="closed">Upon</prep> the spot, as <prep value="closed">upon</prep> all,
        <lb/>And the mystic wind went by
        <lb/>Murmuring in melody—
        <lb/>Then—ah, then, I would <verb value="open">awake</verb>
        <lb/>To the <noun value="closed">terror</noun> of the lone lake.
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
        <lb/>Yet that <noun value="closed">terror</noun> was not fright,
        <lb/>But a tremulous delight—
        <lb/>A feeling not the jewelled mine
        <lb/>Could <verb value="open">teach</verb> or <verb value="closed">bribe</verb> me to define—
        <lb/>Nor Love—although the Love were thine.
    </stanza>
   <stanza>
       <lb/><noun value="open">Death</noun> was in that poisonous wave,
       <lb/>And in its gulf a fitting <noun value="closed">grave</noun>
       <lb/>For him who thence could solace bring
       <lb/>To his lone imagining—
       <lb/>Whose <adj value="closed">solitary</adj> soul could make
       <lb/>An <ref value="biblical">Eden</ref> of that dim lake.
