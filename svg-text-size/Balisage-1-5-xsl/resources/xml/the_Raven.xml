<poem><meta><title>THE RAVEN</title>
<date>1845</date></meta>

<stanza><lb/>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
<lb/><prep value="open">Over</prep> many a quaint and curious volume of <adj value="closed">forgotten</adj> lore--
<lb/>While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
<lb/>As of some one gently rapping--rapping at my <noun value="closed">chamber</noun> door.
<lb/>"'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my <noun value="closed">chamber</noun> door--
<lb/>Only this and nothing more."</stanza>

<stanza><lb/>Ah, distinctly I remember, it was <prep value="closed">in</prep> the bleak December,
<lb/>And each <adj value="open">separate</adj> <adj value="closed">dying</adj> ember wrought its <noun value="closed">ghost</noun> upon the floor.
<lb/>Eagerly I wished the morrow;--vainly I had sought to borrow
<lb/>From my books <verb value="closed">surcease</verb> of sorrow--sorrow for the <adj value="closed">lost</adj> Lenore--
<lb/>For the rare and <adj value="open">radiant</adj> maiden whom the <noun value="open">angels</noun> name Lenore--
<lb/>Nameless here for <noun value="open">evermore</noun>.</stanza>

<stanza><lb/>And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
<lb/>Thrilled me--<verb value="open">filled</verb> me with fantastic terrors <adv value="closed">never</adv> felt before;
<lb/>So that now, to <verb value="closed">still</verb> the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
<lb/>"'Tis some visitor entreating <noun value="open">entrance</noun> at my <noun value="closed">chamber</noun> door--
<lb/>Some late visitor entreating <noun value="open">entrance</noun> at my <noun value="closed">chamber</noun> door;--
<lb/>This it is and nothing more."</stanza>

<stanza><lb/>Presently my soul <verb value="open">grew</verb> stronger; <verb value="closed">hesitating</verb> then no longer,
<lb/>"Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
<lb/>But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
<lb/>And so faintly you came tapping--tapping at my <noun value="closed">chamber</noun> door,
<lb/>That I scarce was sure I heard you"--here I <verb value="open">opened</verb> <adv value="open">wide</adv> the door:--
<lb/>Darkness there and nothing more.</stanza>

<stanza><lb/><adj value="closed">Deep</adj> <prep value="closed">into</prep> that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
<lb/>Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
<lb/>But the silence was <verb value="closed">unbroken</verb>, and the darkness gave no token,
<lb/>And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore!"
<lb/>This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!"
<lb/>Merely this and nothing more.</stanza>

<stanza><lb/>Back <prep value="closed">into</prep> the <noun value="closed">chamber</noun> turning, all my soul <prep value="closed">within</prep> me burning,
<lb/>Soon I heard again a tapping, somewhat louder than before.
<lb/>"Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice;
<lb/>Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore--
<lb/>Let my heart be <adj value="closed">still</adj> a moment, and this mystery explore;--
<lb/>'Tis the wind and nothing more."</stanza>

<stanza><lb/><adj value="open">Open</adj> here I <verb value="open">flung</verb> the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
<lb/><prep value="closed">In</prep> there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;
<lb/>Not the least obeisance made he: not an instant <verb value="closed">stopped</verb> or <verb value="closed">stayed</verb> he;
<lb/>But, with mien of lord or lady, perched <prep value="open">above</prep> my <noun value="closed">chamber</noun> door--
<lb/>Perched upon a bust of <ref value="mythological">Pallas</ref> just <prep value="open">above</prep> my <noun value="closed">chamber</noun> door--
<lb/>Perched, and sat, and nothing more.</stanza>

<stanza><lb/>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy <prep value="closed">into</prep> smiling,
<lb/>By the <noun value="closed">grave</noun> and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
<lb/>"Though thy crest be <adj value="open">shorn</adj> and <adj value="open">shaven</adj>, thou," I said, "art sure no craven,
<lb/>Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore--
<lb/>Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's <ref value="mythological">Plutonian</ref> shore!"
<lb/>Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</stanza>

<stanza><lb/>Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
<lb/>Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;
<lb/>For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
<lb/>Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird <prep value="open">above</prep> his <noun value="closed">chamber</noun> door--
<lb/>Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust <prep value="open">above</prep> his <noun value="closed">chamber</noun> door,
<lb/>With such name as "Nevermore."</stanza>

<stanza><lb/>But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only
<lb/>That one word, as if his soul <prep value="closed">in</prep> that one word he did <verb value="open">outpour</verb>.
<lb/>Nothing further then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered--
<lb/>Till I scarcely more than muttered, "Other friends have <verb value="open">flown</verb> before--
<lb/>On the morrow he will <verb value="open">leave</verb> me, as my hopes have <verb value="open">flown</verb> before."
<lb/>Then the bird said, "Nevermore."</stanza>

<stanza><lb/>Startled at the stillness <verb value="open">broken</verb> by reply so aptly spoken,
<lb/>"Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,
<lb/>Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
<lb/>Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one <noun value="closed">burden</noun> <verb value="closed">bore</verb>--
<lb/>Till the dirges of his Hope the melancholy <noun value="closed">burden</noun> <verb value="closed">bore</verb>
<lb/>Of 'Never--nevermore.'"</stanza>

<stanza><lb/>But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul <prep value="closed">into</prep> smiling,
<lb/>Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat <prep value="closed">in</prep> front of bird and bust and door;
<lb/>Then, upon the velvet <verb value="closed">sinking</verb>, I betook myself to <verb value="closed">linking</verb>
<lb/>Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--
<lb/>What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
<lb/>Meant <prep value="closed">in</prep> croaking "Nevermore."</stanza>

<stanza><lb/>This I sat engaged <prep value="closed">in</prep> guessing, but no syllable expressing
<lb/>To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned <prep value="closed">into</prep> my bosom's <noun value="closed">core</noun>;
<lb/>This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
<lb/>On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated <prep value="open">o'er</prep>,
<lb/>But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating <prep value="open">o'er</prep>,
<lb/>She shall press, ah, nevermore!</stanza>

<stanza><lb/>Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
<lb/>Swung by <ref value="biblical">Seraphim</ref> whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
<lb/>"Wretch," I cried, "thy <noun value="open">God</noun> hath lent thee--by these <noun value="open">angels</noun> he hath sent thee
<lb/><noun value="open">Respite</noun>--<noun value="open">respite</noun> aad <ref value="greek">nepenthé</ref> from thy memories of Lenore!
<lb/>Quaff, oh quaff this kind <ref value="greek">nepenthé</ref>, and <verb value="closed">forget</verb> this <adj value="closed">lost</adj> Lenore!"
<lb/>Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</stanza>

<stanza><lb/>"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or <noun value="closed">devil</noun>!--
<lb/>Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
<lb/><adj value="closed">Desolate</adj> yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--
<lb/>On this home by Horror <verb value="closed">haunted</verb>--tell me truly, I implore--
<lb/>Is there--is there balm in <ref value="location">Gilead</ref>?--tell me--tell me, I implore!"
<lb/>Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</stanza>

<stanza><lb/>"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or <noun value="closed">devil</noun>!
<lb/>By that <noun value="open">Heaven</noun> that bends <prep value="open">above</prep> us--by that <noun value="open">God</noun> we both adore--
<lb/>Tell this soul with sorrow <verb value="closed">laden</verb> if, <prep value="closed">within</prep> the distant <ref value="location">Aidenn</ref>,
<lb/>It shall <verb value="closed">clasp</verb> a sainted maiden whom the <noun value="open">angels</noun> name Lenore--
<lb/><verb value="closed">Clasp</verb> a rare and <adj value="open">radiant</adj> maiden whom the <noun value="open">angels</noun> name Lenore."
<lb/>Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</stanza>

<stanza><lb/>"Be that word our sign of <noun value="open">parting</noun>, bird or fiend!" I shrieked, upstarting--
<lb/>"Get thee back <prep value="closed">into</prep> the tempest and the Night's <ref value="mythological">Plutonian</ref> shore!
<lb/><verb value="open">Leave</verb> no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
<lb/><verb value="open">Leave</verb> my loneliness <adj value="closed">unbroken</adj>!--<verb value="open">quit</verb> the bust <prep value="open">above</prep> my door!
<lb/>Take thy beak from <prep value="open">out</prep> my heart, and take thy form from <prep value="open">off</prep> my door!"
<lb/>Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</stanza>

<stanza><lb/>And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
<lb/>On the pallid bust of <ref value="mythological">Pallas</ref> just <prep value="open">above</prep> my <noun value="closed">chamber</noun> door;
<lb/>And his eyes have all the seeming of a <noun value="closed">demon</noun>'s that is dreaming,
<lb/>And the lamp-light <prep value="open">o'er</prep> him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
<lb/>And my soul from <prep value="open">out</prep> that shadow that lies floating on the floor
<lb/>Shall be <verb value="open">lifted</verb>--nevermore!</stanza>
