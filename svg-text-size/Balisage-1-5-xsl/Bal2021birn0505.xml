        <title>The problem</title>
        <para>SVG layout requires that the developer be in control of the dimensions of the objects
            that must be placed in the coordinate space. It is easy to specify (or compute based on
            other specifications) the size (bounding box height and width) of many SVG objects
            (rectangles, circles, lines), but identifying the bounding box for text is challenging
            because SVG text does not know its own length (or, perhaps surprisingly, its height).
            Developers are able to specify a <code>@font-size</code>, which is related to (but does
            not match) the height of the font (from baseline to baseline) as rendered<footnote>
                <para>If the user does not specify a font size, the default is 16 pixels, which
                    corresponds to specifying the value <code>"medium"</code> for a
                        <code>@font-size</code> attribute on the SVG <code>&lt;text&gt;</code>
                    element. The <code>@font-size</code> setting may be modified before rendering
                    with the global SVG <code>@transform</code> attribute. See below concerning the
                    actual height of SVG <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> elements, which is not the same
                    as the value of the declared or implicit <code>@font-size</code>.</para>
            </footnote>, but the length of a string of characters depends on the widths of the
            individual characters, and those widths are not exposed in any convenient, accessible
            way in a regular XML development environment.</para>
        <para>Our test case for exploring and addressing the challenges <code>&lt;text&gt;</code>
            elements pose for layout is an SVG bar graph like the following:</para>
        <figure xml:id="figure-01" xreflabel="Sample bar graph">
            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata width="12in" fileref="includes/diagonal-graph.svg"/>
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
        </figure>
        <para>In this graph the bars rest on the X axis, and they bear individual slanted labels
            below. Under those labels we label the X axis itself. The challenge involves determining
            the Y position of the general label for the X axis, since that position will depend on
            the length of the longest bar label, and will therefore vary according to the specific
            values of those bar labels. If you are like us, you place that label with a combination
            of guesswork and trial and error and then hard-code a magic number, which—predictably
            and understandably—breaks as soon as you try to reuse the code with new input.<footnote>
                <para>Placing the X axis label more precisely in a way that takes into account the
                    lengths and positions of all of the bar labels is a version of the same type of
                    task, although a more complicated one. For example, if the leftmost and
                    rightmost bar labels are the longest, a human designer might choose to label the
                    X axis, if it is short enough, slightly between them, instead of fully below
                    them. Similarly, a human designer might choose, if the bar labels happen to be
                    longer on one side of the graph than the other, to place the general axis label
                    on the shorter side, below the bar labels on that side, but not below the
                    longest label (on the other side).</para>
                <para>Our modest goal is simply to place the general label for the X axis with
                    reliable precision below the longest bar label. Whether the more exact placement
                    described above would be worth the extra effort cannot be determined in any
                    general way, but because it builds on the same methods as the simpler task, it
                    could, at least in principle, be implemented as an extension of the solution to
                    that simpler task by taking more measurements into consideration when placing
                    the label.</para>

                            unit of writing independently of its presentation. <emphasis role="ital"

                            character. A text strings in our SVG is made up of characters; the
                            rendering of the text inside a browser is a made up of glyphs.</para>
                        <para>The distinction between character and glyph is important in many
                            contexts because it is not necessarily one to one. For example, the
                            writing unit <code>"ä"</code> may be represented as either a single
                            composite character (Unicode U+00E4 <quote>Latin Small Letter A with
                                Diaeresis</quote>) or a sequence of two Unicode characters, one for
                            the base character <code>"a"</code> (U+0061 <quote>Latin Small Letter
                                A</quote>) and one for the combining diacritic (U+0308
                                <quote>Combining diaeresis</quote>). Whether a writing unit is
                            represented as two characters informationally or as one is independent
                            of whether it is rendered in a browser or other platform as two glyphs
                            or as one.</para>
                        <para>In this report we use both terms because we focus on situations where
                            the mapping between characters and glyphs is one to one, or where the
                            distinction does not affect the computation of text length.</para>
                    </footnote> Font metrics are not accessible by default to an XSLT processor, but
                    we can extract and format them in a preprocessing step and then import a
                    machine-accessing mapping from glyph to width into the XSLT that generates the
                    SVG. With this approach, the length of a <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> element is
                    presumed to be the sum of the widths of its constituent characters. If the text
                    strings are horizontal or vertical, the length is one of the dimensions of the
                    bounding box, and the other dimension is (approximately) the font size. If the
                    text is rotated, we can apply trigonometric functions to the length of the text
                    (which functions as the hypotenuse) and the angle of rotation to compute the
                    dimensions (the adjacent and opposites sides of a right triangle) of the
                    bounding box.</para>

                    components that must be stacked vertically as separate <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code>
                    elements with no height specified. These would wind up with a default height in
                    a browser that would be wrong initially. We use CSS Flexbox to stack the
                        <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> elements vertically, and employ the JavaScript
                        <code>element.getBBox()</code> function to compute the dimensions of the
                    bounding box for each of the vertically stacked <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code>
                    elements. We can then write the computed height values of each
                        <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> element into the DOM, effectively assigning a
                    height after loading the SVG into the browser, instead of when creating it with

            <title>An XSLT approach</title>
            <section>
                <title>Overview</title>
                <para>The XSLT approach computes the dimensions of the text as it creates the SVG
                    and positions other elements accordingly. For horizontal or vertical text this
                    requires computing the length of the <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> and using it to
                    position other elements at a specific distance from it. This approach is less
                    precise than the JavaScript method described below for several reasons, but
                    because in our actual use we normally want to include a small amount of padding
                    around our <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> elements, we do not require placement with
                    exact precision.</para>
                <para>In the sample SVG below, we compute the length of the text using the method
                    described above and employ it to draw a line parallel to horizontal or vertical
                    text, so that we can examine the accuracy of our measurements visually. (That
                    is, the lines are not created as a font effect; the lines are drawn
                    independently of the text.) In the case of diagonal text we draw a bounding
                    rectangle. The third of the four examples in each figure is a null string, so we
                    expect to see no text and no line. The images below are in SVG that is rendered
                    in the browser, which means that the exact appearance may vary depending on
                    browser features:</para>

                        </listitem>
                    </itemizedlist></para>
                <para>At the same time, these examples reveal several limitations. One limitation to
                    computing the dimensions of SVG <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> elements while
                    creating them is that <emphasis role="ital">user agents</emphasis> (typically
                    browsers) may impose small unpredictable modifications on the layout. For
                    example, the last of the horizontal examples above specifies a
                        <code>@font-size</code> of <code>"16"</code> (which is the SVG and CSS
                    default when no size is specified) and computes a length of 297.703125. However,
                    when when we open the SVG in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari and use the JavaScript
                        <code>getBBox()</code> method to query the size of the bounding box, the
                    three browsers report slightly different values for both height and width<footnote>

                <para>A second limitation to computing the dimensions of SVG
                        <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> elements while creating them is that the height of
                    an SVG <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> element is not fully predictable from its
                        <code>@font-size</code> attribute. In the table above, we see that none of
                    the browsers sets a height of 16 and each of them sets a different height from
                    the others.<footnote>
                        <para>The apparently widespread assumption that a <code>@font-size</code>
                            value specifies the vertical distance between baselines is incorrect
                            because, among other things, the actual spacing depends on the font
                            design, and not only on font size. See <xref linkend="deOliveira2017"/>
                            for details and discussion. In principle it should be possible to
                            extract the actual height from the font metrics, as we do for character
                            width, but we have not explored that possibility for this report.</para>

                        <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> elements while creating them is that kerning
                    support in browsers is inconsistent, and user-controlled kerning support in SVG
                    and CSS is unreliable. Whether you see kerning applied in the horizontal,
                    vertical, and diagonal samples above will depend on your browser. The images
                    below are PNG screen captures of the three samples in the versions of Firefox
                    (left), Chrome (middle), and Safari (right) mentioned above. All three apply
                    kerning to the horizontal text; Firefox and Chrome also apply kerning to the

                <para>The strategy for positioning objects at a specific distance from rotated text
                    is similar to the strategy for vertical text, except that instead of using the
                    length of the diagonal text, we need to compute the vertical space it occupies.
                    We again start with vertical text and transform it by rotating it away from the
                    vertical with <code>transform="rotate()"</code>. <code>rotate()</code> takes
                    three arguments: the angle of rotation (in degrees) and the X and Y coordinates
                    of the center of rotation, which we map to the X and Y coordinates of the
                        <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> element.<footnote>
                        <para>This approach rotates the text around its starting position (left edge
                            and vertical center in this left-to-right example), so that the upper

                            top of the center of rotation, and the lower right corner behaves
                            similarly. Because we do not require high precision, we ignore these
                            protrusions.</para>
                    </footnote> If we regard the length of the text as the hypotenuse of a right
                    angle that has been rotated counter-clockwise away from true vertical, the
                    vertical height of the rotated text is the adjacent side of the right triangle,
                    which we can compute as <emphasis role="ital">hypotenuse * cosθ</emphasis>.<footnote>
                        <para>Inconveniently, SVG rotation requires that angles be expressed in
                            degrees, while XPath trigonometic functions in the <code>math:</code>

                <para><code>getBBox()</code> is not sensitive to transformations that have been
                    applied to an object, and <xref linkend="primer-getBoundingClientRect"/>
                    proposes the use of <code>getCTM()</code> to work around this limitation. We
                    find it simpler to wrap the transformed object(s) in an SVG
                        <code>&lt;g&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> element; because those
                    objects are not themselves transformed, <code>getBBox()</code> reports their
                    actual coordinates correctly even when they contain descendant elements that
                    have undergone transformation with the SVG <code>@transform</code> attribute,
                    such as scaling, rotation, translation, or skewing.</para>

                <para>Pro: Does not require preparation of font metric information in advance (a
                    benefit both initially and with respect to scalability). Adapts to viewing
                    environment, and therefore supports user overrides of default. Does not require
                    webfont. Does not require additional logic to deal with font effects (e.g.,
                    ligatures, positional glyph variants) or transformations</para>
                <para>Con: Requires JavaScript programming knowledge. Works only in
                    DOM-and-JavaScript-aware environments (e.g., works in a web browser, but not as
                    an included image in a Balisage (Docbook-based) document. Not all JavaScript
                    methods (including <code>getBBox()</code>) are sensitive to transformations that
                    have been performed on an object.</para>

        <para>Our XSLT approach assumes that the font metrics that can be extracted from the font
            files are sufficient to compute the length of an SVG line of text. Our implementation
            does attempt to access kerning information, and it has not been tested on writing
            systems that involve character substitution (including positional glyph variation or
            ligation) or glyph reordering. It is not impacted negatively by zero-width characters as
            long as the font metrics for those glyphs correctly report a width of zero.</para>
        <para>Font availability on a user system is not fully predictable, especially over time, so
            supplying a webfont is more robust then trusting that every browser will use, for
            example, a Times New Roman font with the same font metrics.</para>
        <para>Saxon-JS</para>
        <para>Saxon-JS relies on a JavaScript implementation of the XSLT engine that is designed to
            perform transformations inside the browser. Insofar as Saxon-JS incorporates both XSLT
            and JavaScript functionality, it may provide a cleaner integration of the two
            approaches.</para>

            script has two positional arguments, a required path to the font and an optional point
